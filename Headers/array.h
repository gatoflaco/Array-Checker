|===========================================================================================================|
|   This header contains classes for managing the array in an automated fashion. The Row class is just a    |
| helper used by the Array class and should not be instantiated by any source file other than the one       |
| associated with this header. The Array class is the interface with which other source files should work.  |
| It contains a constructor that builds all the internal data structures, thereby allowing the instantiator |
| to immediately call other methods which carry out analyses on this data. See check.cpp for an example.    |
| Please note this file is not intended to be highly integrable with other projects working with arrays. It |
| supports the very specific purposes of the LA-Checker project and is not generalized for anything else.   |
